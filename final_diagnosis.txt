## Diagnosis: East Coast Fever (Theileria parva)  
**Issue:** Tick-borne disease caused by the parasite Theileria parva.  
**Severity Level:** High (if untreated, mortality rates can exceed 90%).  
**Confidence Level:** Medium (based on symptoms like high fever, anemia, and swelling of lymph nodes; confirm with blood tests and tick identification).  

## Immediate Actions:  
1. **Isolate Affected Cattle:** Quarantine sick animals to prevent further spread.  
2. **Consult a Veterinarian:** Contact the nearest veterinary office in Mombasa for a confirmed diagnosis and treatment plan.  
3. **Administer Treatment:** Follow veterinarian-prescribed antiparasitic drugs (e.g., parvaquone) and supportive care (e.g., fluids, anti-inflammatory medications).  
4. **Tick Control:** Apply acaricides (e.g., amitraz, cypermethrin) to all cattle to eliminate ticks.  
5. **Monitor Herd:** Regularly check for symptoms in other animals and treat as needed.  

**Required Inputs/Materials:**  
- Acaricides (e.g., amitraz, cypermethrin)  
- Antiparasitic drugs (e.g., parvaquone)  
- Veterinary consultation  
- Quarantine facilities  

**Timeline for Action:**  
- Immediate: Isolate affected cattle and consult a veterinarian.  
- Within 24 hours: Begin treatment and tick control measures.  
- Ongoing: Monitor herd for 2-3 weeks.  

## Regional Considerations:  
- **Weather Impact:** Heavy rainfall and high humidity (80%) create ideal conditions for tick proliferation, increasing disease risk.  
- **Local Availability:** Acaricides and veterinary services are available in Mombasa, but supply may be limited during the rainy season.  
- **Market Implications:** Cattle prices are increasing, making prompt treatment crucial to protect investment.  

## Prevention:  
1. **Regular Tick Control:** Use acaricides every 3-4 weeks during the rainy season.  
2. **Vaccination:** Implement a vaccination program against East Coast Fever.  
3. **Quarantine New Animals:** Isolate and inspect new cattle before introducing them to the herd.  
4. **Pasture Management:** Rotate grazing areas to reduce tick populations.  

## Cost Estimate:  
- **Treatment Costs:**  
  - Acaricides: KES 2,000–5,000 per treatment.  
  - Antiparasitic drugs: KES 1,500–3,000 per animal.  
  - Veterinary consultation: KES 3,000–5,000.  
- **Expected Outcomes:** With prompt treatment, survival rates can improve to 50-70%. Early intervention is critical to minimize losses.
